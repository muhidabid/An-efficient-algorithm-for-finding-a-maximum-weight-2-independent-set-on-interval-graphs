Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an O(n) time algorithm to solve the maximum weight independent set problem on an interval graph with n vertices given its interval representation with sorted endpoints list. Based on this linear algorithm, we design an O(n2) time algorithm using O(n2) space to solve the maximum weight 2-independent set problem on an interval graph with n vertices. With a slight extension and modification of our algorithm, the maximum weight k-independent set problem on an interval graph with n vertices can be solved in O(nk) time using O(nk) space.
